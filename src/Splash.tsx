                            I'm Isabel, a passionate interface and experience designer from

                            I live in Austin, Texas and work at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.peddle.com/">Peddle</a>.

                            I‚Äôm a UX designer with a desire to turn ambiguity into innovative experiences. Rooted in my Puerto Rican upbringing, I thoroughly believe in the power of community and collaboration as a way to tackle complex problems and, as a result, create impactful solutions.

                        <p>
                            I've focused on print and graphic design for the past 4 years and now I‚Äôm using those skills to creating unique product experiences at Peddle. I passionately believe that great design is all about asking the right questions.

                            Away from my computer, you‚Äôll most likely find me: cooking, enjoying live music, rushing to get to a pilates class, and occasionally, (if I‚Äôm in luck and she feels like it) cuddling with my dog, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aryathehuskygp/">Arya</a>.
